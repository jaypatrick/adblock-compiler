# Framework PoCs — Alpha / Experimental

> **Status: Alpha** — These implementations are incubator-stage experiments.
> They are not production code. APIs and UIs may change without notice.

## Overview

The `poc/` directory contains proof-of-concept implementations of the Adblock
Compiler frontend in four popular JavaScript frameworks. Each PoC explores how
the existing vanilla HTML/CSS/JS UI could be rewritten using a modern framework,
and serves as an evaluation baseline before any production migration decision is
made.

| PoC | Technology | Run method |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| [React](../poc/react/index.html) | React 18 · React Router v6 · Babel Standalone | Open in browser (CDN) |
| [Vue 3](../poc/vue/index.html) | Vue 3 · Vue Router 4 · Pinia · Composition API | Open in browser (CDN) |
| [Angular](../poc/angular/) | Angular 19 · TypeScript · RxJS · Signals | `npm install && npm start` |
| [Svelte 5](../poc/svelte/) | Svelte 5 · Vite · Runes | `npm install && npm run dev` |

A side-by-side overview is available at [`/poc/index.html`](../poc/index.html).

## What Each PoC Demonstrates

All four implementations cover the same feature set:

- **Client-side routing** — full SPA navigation without page reloads
- **Component architecture** — decomposed, reusable UI building blocks
- **State management** — local and global reactive state (Hooks/Context, Pinia,
  Signals, Runes)
- **Theme toggle** — dark/light mode with `localStorage` persistence
- **API integration** — `POST /api/compile` with loading and error states
- **Benchmark page** — measures compilation API performance with `performance.now()`

## Build & Distribution

The `poc/` directory is included in every production build:

```bash
# Part of: npm run ui:build → npm run ui:copy-static
cp -r poc dist/poc
```

After building, the PoC files are served as static assets alongside the main UI:

```
/poc/index.html          ← Framework comparison hub
/poc/react/index.html    ← React PoC
/poc/vue/index.html      ← Vue 3 PoC
/poc/angular/            ← Angular PoC (requires local dev server)
/poc/svelte/             ← Svelte PoC (requires local dev server)
```

The Angular and Svelte PoCs require their own local dev servers because they
depend on Node.js build tools and cannot be opened directly as static files.

## Alpha Designation

These PoCs are labelled **Alpha** because:

- They are feature-incomplete (no admin, storage, or WebSocket pages)
- They use CDN-delivered libraries not yet reviewed for security compliance
- No automated tests exist for the PoC UI code
- No framework migration decision has been made
- Breaking changes may occur at any time

Use them for evaluation, learning, and prototyping. Do not reference them from
production documentation or expose them as supported user-facing features.
