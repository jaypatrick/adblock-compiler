# Frontend Framework Migration - Proof of Concept

This directory contains proof-of-concept implementations of the Adblock Compiler frontend in three popular JavaScript frameworks: **React**, **Vue 3**, and **Angular 17+**.

## 📋 Overview

Each PoC demonstrates how the existing vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend would be implemented in a modern framework, showcasing:

- ✅ Component-based architecture
- ✅ Client-side routing (SPA)
- ✅ State management (forms, theme, API data)
- ✅ Theme toggle (dark/light mode)
- ✅ API integration pattern
- ✅ Loading and error states
- ✅ Form validation

## 🎯 PoC Implementations

### 1. React PoC ([react/index.html](./react/index.html))

**Technology Stack:**

- React 18 (via CDN)
- React Router v6 (via CDN)
- Babel Standalone (for JSX transformation)

**Key Patterns:**

- Functional components with Hooks
- `useState` for local state
- `useEffect` for side effects
- Context API for theme management
- Controlled components for forms
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- React Server Components (simulated) — server/client component split

**Routing:**

React Router v6 is used for client-side navigation. It provides instant page transitions without full browser reloads, keeps the browser URL in sync with the rendered view, and enables deep linking, bookmarking, and proper browser history support. See [react/REACT_ROUTER.md](./react/REACT_ROUTER.md) for a detailed explanation of why React Router is the right choice for this project.

**Server Components:**

The `/server-components` route demonstrates the React Server Components architecture pattern: how the component tree splits into server-rendered (data-fetching, zero client JS) and client-rendered (interactive, hooks) parts, and why this benefits the Adblock Compiler. See [react/REACT_SERVER_COMPONENTS.md](./react/REACT_SERVER_COMPONENTS.md) for the full rationale.

**How to Run:**

```bash
cd poc/react
# Open index.html in a web browser
# OR serve with a local server:
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit: http://localhost:8000
```

**Advantages:**

- 🚀 Huge ecosystem and community
- 📚 Abundant learning resources
- 🔧 Flexible and unopinionated
- ⚡ Great performance with Virtual DOM
- 🧩 Rich component library ecosystem

**Considerations:**

- Requires build tooling for production (Vite, webpack)
- More decisions to make (state management, routing)
- JSX learning curve

---

### 2. Vue 3 PoC ([vue/index.html](./vue/index.html))

**Technology Stack:**

- Vue 3 (via CDN)
- Vue Router 4 (via CDN)
- Composition API

**Key Patterns:**

- Vue Router for declarative routing, named routes, and route metadata
- Route parameters with `useRoute()` for bookmarkable application states
- Programmatic navigation with `useRouter().push()`
- Navigation guards with `router.beforeEach()` for cross-cutting concerns
- Composition API with `setup()`
- `ref()` and `reactive()` for reactive state
- `computed()` for derived state
- `watch()` for side effects
- Template-based declarative rendering
- Two-way data binding with `v-model`
- Composables for reusable logic

**Why Vue Router Is Worth Using:**

Vue Router is not just a convenience layer — it enables architectural patterns that would be
painful to implement by hand:

| Benefit | What it Gives You |
| --- | --- |
| **Declarative links** | `<router-link>` auto-applies active classes; no DOM querying needed |
| **Programmatic navigation** | `router.push('/compiler/dns')` from any component or service |
| **Route parameters** | `/compiler/:preset` makes URLs shareable and bookmarkable |
| **Navigation guards** | `router.beforeEach()` centralises auth, analytics, and title updates |
| **Route metadata** | Attach arbitrary data (`meta.title`, `meta.requiresAuth`) to routes |
| **Lazy loading** | `component: () => import('./Page.vue')` splits routes into separate chunks |
| **Nested routes** | Multi-level `<router-view>` outlets for complex layouts |
| **Named routes** | Stable names decouple navigation code from URL structure |

The Vue PoC demonstrates the first five of these benefits in a single CDN-based HTML file.

**How to Run:**

```bash
cd poc/vue
# Open index.html in a web browser
# OR serve with a local server:
python3 -m http.server 8001
# Then visit: http://localhost:8001
```

**Advantages:**

- 🎨 Progressive framework (start simple, scale up)
- 📖 Excellent documentation
- 🔄 Two-way data binding
- 🎯 Intuitive template syntax
- ⚡ Great performance with reactivity system
- 🛠️ Official router and state management

**Considerations:**

- Smaller ecosystem than React
- Less corporate backing
- Composition API is newer (learning curve)

### 3. Angular PoC ([angular/](./angular/))

**Technology Stack:**

- Angular 17+ (Standalone Components)
- TypeScript
- RxJS
- Reactive Forms

**Key Patterns:**

- Standalone components (no NgModules)
- Dependency Injection
- Reactive Forms with FormBuilder
- RxJS Observables for async operations
- Services for business logic
- Structural directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`)
- Component-scoped styles

**How to Run:**

```bash
cd poc/angular
npm install
npm start
# Visit: http://localhost:4200
```

**Advantages:**

- 🏢 Enterprise-ready framework
- 📘 Full TypeScript integration
- 🧰 Complete solution (router, forms, HTTP, testing)
- 🔒 Strong typing and interfaces
- 🎓 Opinionated architecture (consistency)
- 💼 Popular in enterprise environments

**Considerations:**

- Steeper learning curve
- More boilerplate code
- Larger bundle size
- Requires Node.js and build tools

## 🔧 API Integration

All PoCs use the same API contract:

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/compile`

**Request:**

```json
{
    "configuration": {
        "name": "Filter List Name",
        "sources": [
            { "source": "https://example.com/filters.txt" }
        ],
        "transformations": [
            "RemoveComments",
            "Deduplicate",
            "TrimLines",
            "RemoveEmptyLines"
        ]
    },
    "benchmark": true
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "ruleCount": 1234,
  "sources": 1,
  "transformations": [...],
  "benchmark": {
    "duration": "123ms",
    "rulesPerSecond": 10000
  }
}
```

**Available Transformations:**

- RemoveComments
- Compress
- RemoveModifiers
- Validate
- ValidateAllowIp
- Deduplicate
- InvertAllow
- RemoveEmptyLines
- TrimLines
- InsertFinalNewLine
- ConvertToAscii

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### React & Vue (CDN Versions)

- Single HTML file, no build step required
- Suitable for PoC and small projects
- For production, use Vite or other build tools

### Angular

- Requires Node.js and npm
- Uses Angular CLI for development
- Production-ready setup out of the box

### Production Considerations

1. **Build Process**: All frameworks need bundling for production
2. **Code Splitting**: Lazy load routes and components
3. **SEO**: Consider SSR (Next.js, Nuxt, Angular Universal)
4. **PWA**: Add service workers for offline support
5. **Testing**: Set up unit and E2E tests
6. **CI/CD**: Automate builds and deployments

## 🧪 Testing the PoCs

### React & Vue (CDN)

1. Open the HTML file directly in a browser
2. Or serve with a local HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   npx http-server
   ```

### Angular

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm start`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`
